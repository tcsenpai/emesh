# eMesh

## A human-usable fast and universal GUI for Meshtastic nodes

### What is eMesh?

eMesh is an interface initially made for myself to be able to better control, understand and play with devices used in the [Meshtastic Project](https://meshtastic.org/). A brief and absolutely not definitive list of supported devices is provided in the next section.

### Compatible devices

Any device that is compatible with the current Meshtastic for Python version should be supported without any problems. However, is important to note that our tests have been made against the following devices:

â€¢ LilyGo LORA32

### Features

- [x] A fully functional GUI for Meshtastic even if you are using the terminal (thanks [Textualize for its Textual library](https://github.com/Textualize/textual))
- [x] Conda support for both CLI and TUI versions
- [x] Serial Port connection (serial or usb over serial)
- [x] Support for beaconing (emitting a signal every X seconds)
	- [ ] Support for beaconing time customization
- [x] Possibility of specifying the serial port to use
- [x] Listening and showing messages in a clear and clean way
- [x] Easy to use chat-like interface with advanced commands


### Installation and usage

	git clone https://github.com/thecookingsenpai/emesh
	cd emesh

#### TUI Version (textual GUI)

***NOTE: This is the suggested way of running emesh on capable machines (from raspberry pi zero to infinite)***

Using pip:

	pip install -r requirements.txt
	python gui.py

Using conda (suggested):

	conda env create --file environment.yaml
	conda activate emesh-env
	python gui.py


#### CLI Version

***NOTE: This is the suggested way of running emesh on low specs machines (sub-raspberry pi zero)***

Using pip:

	pip install -r requirements_cli.txt
	python term.py

Using conda (suggested):

	conda env create --file environment_cli.yaml
	conda activate emesh-env-cli
	python term.py
